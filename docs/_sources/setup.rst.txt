A quick note on Python

Databaker should work on python2 but its mainly aimed at (and tested) on python 3 and it's usually best to run it under that unless you've a powerful reason not to.

Under windows it's easiest to install Anaconda python3 64bit (make sure it's the python3.5+ version, as a py2 version does exist).

On a mac you can just:

`brew install python3`.



Install
=========


`pip install pandas`

`pip install databaker`

`pip install jupyter`

Some of these may say "already installed" but that's fine. Better safe than sorry.
