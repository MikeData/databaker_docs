# databaker_docs
A sphinx generator repo for databaker documentation.

the "html version" of this repo. Can be found here:




## usage

Sphinx used reStructuredText as a markup language for creating documention (it's very similar to the way florence works).

To update the documentation you just install sphinx

`pip install sphinx`

then change the relevent .rst file (or add some new ones) and run the publish.sh shell script or the publish.bat batch file (coming soon). That will update this repo as well as the branch that "holds" the html version.

everything else should take care of itself.
